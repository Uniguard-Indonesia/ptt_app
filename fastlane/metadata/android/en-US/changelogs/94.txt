This release is made for adapting Mumla to newer Android versions, as is required by the Google Play store. Mumla should now run on Android 12.

In particular, the exporting of Mumla's client certificates has been adapted to work with Android 11+.

Also some new translations since the last release. Thank you! anonymous, Abidin, Alfonso, deluxghost, Gabriel, Jaroslav, Kityn, Maite, OÄŸuz, pjammo, Vinicius, WLJ, Wesley
